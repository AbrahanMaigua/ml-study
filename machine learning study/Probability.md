Thanks! Here’s the full transcription of the content from the new screenshot:

### **Probability of an event "A"**
$$
P(A) = \frac{\# \text{ ways A can happen}}{\# \text{ of things that can happen}}
$$
---

### **Example (Left): I flip a coin twice**
$$
Ω ={hh,ht,th,tt}\Omega = \{hh, ht, th, tt\}
$$
1. **A = at least one heads**
    
$$
A={hh,ht,th}⇒P(A)=34=75%A = \{hh, ht, th\} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(A) = \frac{3}{4} = 75\%
$$
2. **B = no heads**
    
$$
B={tt}⇒P(B)=14=25%B = \{tt\} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(B) = \frac{1}{4} = 25\%
$$

### **Example (Right): I roll two dice**

**1. Probability at least one die is a 5?**
$$
Ω={11,12,13,14,15,...,66}\Omega = \{11, 12, 13, 14, 15, ..., 66\} A={15,25,35,45,51,52,53,54,55,56,65}A = \{15, 25, 35, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 65\} P(A)=1136P(A) = \frac{11}{36}
$$
Diagram shows branching tree (sample space visualization)

At bottom:
$$
16+56⋅16=P(A)=P(D1=5)+P(D1≠5)⋅P(D2=5)\frac{1}{6} + \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = P(A) = P(D_1 = 5) + P(D_1 \neq 5) \cdot P(D_2 = 5)
