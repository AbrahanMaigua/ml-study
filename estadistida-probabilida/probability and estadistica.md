**modeling uncertainty... with DATA**

**Prob:** assume known prob. dist.  
  ... Samples unknown

**Stats:** Data is known  
  ... prob. dist. unknown

---

**Examples:**

- Gas → Temp/Ent.
    
- Turbulence
    
- Measurement error (Gaussian)
    
- Kalman filter → SDEs
    
- Weather (Chaotic)
    
- Human behavior

**P(x|θ)**  
**P(θ|x)**

---

**STATISTICS**

- Hypothesis testing
    
- Survey sampling
    
- ...
    
- fitting, estimates
    
- ML

**I.** Intro to Probability  
  Examples / Intuition  
  Counting sets

---

**II.** Random Variable **X** & function / Distributions  
  **X ~ P(X = x | θ)**  
  - Bernoulli  
  - Binomial  
  - exp  
  - Normal  
  - Poisson  
  - ...

  Sometimes dist. is unknown (**ML**)

**III.** Expected value, variance, SD, median

---

**IV.** Central Limit Theorem  
  **Xi**, i = 1,...,n  
  **X̄ = 1/n Σ xi ~ normal(μ, σ²)**
